# Reduce coupling in this code:
# - extending collection classes (or any class not explicitly
#   meant to be extended) is seldom a good idea. Fix this.
# - add a method to return a member by name 'member_named(name)'
# - refactor to make name lookup more efficient
# - add country to Member and make old_enough_to_drink? vary based on
#   country:
#     USA - 21
#     Canada - 19
#     Azerbaijan - 16
#     Afghanistan - 1000 ( i.e. illegal)
#     Malta - 17
#     Russia - 0
#     Iceland - 20
# - make it easy to add new contries without having to edit Member for each
